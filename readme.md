# Array in JavaScript
>An array is an object that holds values (of any type) not particularly in named properties/keys, 
but rather in numerically indexed position
In JavaScript, an array is an ordered list of values. Each value is called an element specified by 
an index. ... First, an array can hold values of mixed types.
An array is a special variable, which can hold more than one value:

# CHANGE ELEMENTS IN ARRAY
>You can also add elements or change the elements by accessing the index value
Suppose, an array has two elements. If you try to add an element at index 3 (fourth 
element), the third element will be undefined. For example,

# array method push
>The push() method of Array instances adds the specified elements to the end of an array and returns the new length of the array.

# array method pop
>The pop() method removes the last element from an array and returns that value to the caller. If you call pop() on an empty array, it returns undefined . Array.prototype.shift() has similar behavior to pop() , but applied to the first element in an array.

# array method unshift 
>The unshift() method adds one or more elements to the beginning of an array and
returns the new length of the array. 
unshift(element0, element1, /* â€¦ ,*/ elementN)

# array method shift
>The pop() method removes the last element from an array and returns that element. 
This method changes the length of the array.

# array method toString
>The toString() method returns a string representing the specified array and its
elements. 
A string representing the elements of the array.

>The indexOf() method returns the first index (position) of a specified value. The indexOf() method returns -1 if the value is not found. The indexOf() method starts at a specified index and searches from left to right. By default the search starts at the first element and ends at the last.
